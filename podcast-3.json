Why so popular? And why now? Are they even a good idea? My guest is Kelsey Lerick, co-founder and CEO of an e-commerce holding company and co-founder of the Holdco Conference, HoldcoConf. Our conversation is anchored around a survey of Holdco operators that Kelsey and his team recently ran. A bunch of interesting findings here. And Kelsey, as a guy who is both a Holdco entrepreneur himself and the guy who runs a conference on the topic, brought lots of anecdotal color to the conversation. Also, check the show notes where we've linked to all 12 Acquiring Minds interviews with Holdco entrepreneurs. Please enjoy this interview with Kelsey Lerick of 365 Holdings. Welcome to Acquiring Minds, a podcast about buying businesses. My name is Will Smith. Acquiring an existing business is an awesome opportunity for many entrepreneurs. And on this podcast, I talk to the people who do it. I want to share an update on the Acquisition Lab. As you know, the lab is a highly vetted, cohort-based accelerator and community for people serious about buying a business. After going through the lab's month-long intensive, you have ongoing access to almost daily Q&A sessions with advisors, regular live deal reviews with Walker Dybul, author of Buy Then Build, potential deal team introductions, and a very active Slack group with other searchers on the path. Well, the update is that the lab recently passed 60 businesses acquired and for well over $100 million in aggregate transaction value. Also, all members now enjoy lifetime access to the lab. Because when you buy a business, it's often just the first of many, and the lab wants to support you in every deal, not just your first. Lastly, check out my recent interview with Shane Ersam, episode 105. Shane acquired a business with over a million dollars in EBITDA in just six months, and he attributes a lot of his deal success to what he learned in the lab.

Kelsey, you are the co-founder and CEO of 365 Holdings, a holding company of e-commerce DTC businesses. You were an early guest on Acquiring Minds. You are also a co-founder of HoldcoConf, the unconference for holding company operators and entrepreneurs. And as part of the conference, you recently surveyed Holdco entrepreneurs to better understand this whole phenomenon of small business holdcos. Today, we're going to hear what you learned from the survey results. But first, Kelsey, would you give us some quick background on who you are, please? For sure. And again, thanks for having me back on. A number of years ago, my business partner and I bought our first e-commerce business. Prior to that, we had some small companies, but never really achieved much scale. If you fast forward from that first e-commerce business to today, we've got a sizable team and a sizable portfolio of various e-commerce businesses selling mostly direct to consumer, a little bit on Amazon. We tend to get lumped into that e-commerce aggregator world. Although we have not raised any outside equity capital, we're self-funded and bootstrapped. We are an e-commerce platform that buys and operates e-commerce businesses. Do you share revenue numbers across the entire portfolio? Is that something you can do? Yep. Revenue, typically not, but headcount, we're just over 100 globally, and we're heavily vertically integrated. So in there, we have everything ranging from executive leadership all the way down to production workers and global contractors doing things like customer service or accounting. We're incredibly heavily vertical in our supply chain. So we make some of the things that we sell, and we also pick back and ship many of the things that we sell. Great. For reference, multiple eight figures of revenue. Okay, Kelsey. Tell us about the genesis of HoltcoConf. A couple of years ago, I met John Wilson, I think also, who has been a guest on your show, the Wilson Companies here in Northeast Ohio. I realized John and I had some similarities, similar point in life personally with family and age and kids, and similar businesses. Revenue was in the neighborhood, headcount was in the neighborhood. All of our problems were certainly very similar, whether it was financing or shared services or acquisitions or hiring. We just became fast friends, and we met through the magic of the internet. We realized that we both went to various industry conferences. I would go to e-commerce events, he would go to plumbing or HVAC events. We'd both find ourselves at things like SM Bash or Capital Camp. But there really wasn't a specific home for Holtcos. If you identified as a primarily multi-business entrepreneur, if you said, I own multiple companies, I'm the founder of a portfolio of businesses, I'm not really private equity, but I'm also not just a SaaS entrepreneur. I'm not just a restaurant owner, whatever category you might be in. There just wasn't a home for that, so we set out to launch the home for that called HoltcoConf, which is an annual event where holding company founders, executives, investors, entrepreneurs, meet for two and a half days of fun and learning because the challenges of running a portfolio of businesses are different than the challenges of scaling. Even a roll-up just in one industry is just very different. The topics that we cover for a couple of days with HoltcoConf is trying to bring the best and brightest together from small business holding companies to share best practices, build relationships, have a lot of fun while we do it, and support small business Holtcos. Awesome, Kelsey. Two follow-up questions. First, interesting to hear you say that part of the ingredients of your chemistry with John is that you found that the problems that you have were similar. What you'll often hear about blue collar businesses, field crew businesses, is that if you look under the hood of these businesses, be it plumbing or HVAC or foundation repair or disaster remediation, that there's a lot of similarities. There's a lot of similarities like there's a lot of overlap and the problems are the same. But I wasn't ever sure that that actually extended to other categories of business. So interesting to hear that an e-commerce holding company, a quote digital business, and John's business, which is plumbing, actually do under the hood kind of have a similar problem set. I forget who to credit it to, but somebody refers to the everything tastes like chicken layer of business, meaning that finance is finance. You got to reconcile your books. Hiring is hiring. You got to have a process for bringing in good people. Leadership and management and accountability, whether it's something like EOS or just some other system of daily operations, those transcend industries. So certainly John and I might disagree on the finer points of how he tightens a wrench on something or how I run a Facebook ad. And that's where our topics diverge. But that everything tastes like chicken layer of running a company really is homogenous. And my opinion, I think in his and others of the experience of being an entrepreneur running more than one business, there's a lot of commonalities there in our opinion. That's great. That's really interesting, Kelsey. And then the second question was holdcos are hot. I've had many holdco entrepreneurs on this podcast. Those episodes always really perform well. But the idea of owning multiple businesses without applying this label to it is nothing new. Just like I guess search and buying a business is nothing new. But why do you think that it kind of became trendy in the last year or two, three? There's certainly a pocket of the internet that has some overlapping influences. I think you and I might've emailed about this, but it's probably an intersection of Tim Ferriss, Robert Kiyosaki, and Berkshire Hathaway or value investing. And if you put all that into a blender, you might get an entrepreneur that wants to run a lean portfolio of businesses that can compound retained earnings. And it's certainly easy to see some big names that have holding companies, many of which have been guests on your podcast. I could rattle off the list of well-known names like Andrew Wilkinson at Tiny or the Higgins at Chenmark or Be Sure at Permanent Equity. There's a long list of, I think, people that have aspirational holding companies. And Durian Ventures is on that list. There's others. They publish content on the internet. They've been on podcasts. And it's very easy for somebody interested in ETA to when they approach buying a business to say, hey, one is fun, but two or more sounds like a real party. We should do this portfolio thing. So I think that there's an intersection of kind of culture. And I do think literally it comes down to the media that many of us might have consumed over the years, both financial and otherwise, and then the prevalence of some really aspirational, really impressive stories being told about doing this at scale. There's also plenty of stories in any given industry about building one big business. But I think there is an awareness that deals are hard to find. And it might be easier if your target is some revenue metric, call it 50 or $100 million, whatever it is, it might be easier to get there, cobbling together a group of things than to find the one sports car, the racehorse that you can grow to that level or take to that level. So I think there's kind of a confluence of factors that makes it popular for hold entrepreneurs. And it ranges from culture to these impressive names that are building in public to a degree and sharing some of their successes. I agree with all of that. And I'll just add to that, Kelsey. I mean, I really liked what you said about if one is good, two is better sort of thing. I think just the way that you put it, just with the increasing popularity of search and the idea of ETA buying an existing business, it was inevitable that people would eventually say to themselves, you know, further along the path, more mature in the business that they bought, would say to themselves, well, can I buy another one of these? And what does it look like if I really scale this pattern of buying a small business and do it again and again? So it's almost like less trendy and more just inevitable. I mean, it's kind of the next step as a business buyer that you're going to kind of arrive at. One of the debates I've had about this notion of focus versus ColdCo. So I have a friend who has a very large, very successful financial publishing business. And we just had a fake Twitter beef about this. It was kind of fun. But throughout the dialogue of giving each other a hard time about him focusing on a very big, very successful business, I admire a lot and him kind of teasing me. I realized that in many small businesses, I would include the ones that we own and operate, you can get 90% of the results with 10% of the effort. And yeah, 100% of the effort can get more than 90% of results. But there's some breakdown of that marginal effort. And for a high strong entrepreneur that is trying to maximize their time, you might find yourself running a $3 million septic business. And you realize you can do it in 20 hours a week, or you can do it in 40. But the financial result is within, you know, a small percentage point, maybe you should work half time and go find something else. I've certainly seen that happen in my business where could we put more effort? Yes. Is it marginally accretive? No, we should probably move on and capital allocate that time or those dollars to the next project. Because many small businesses have a constrained, total addressable market, you can only grow it so profitably. And so inevitably, if you want to grow, you end up diversifying. I love that point. And I'm going to say a kind of a similar point, but not from the kind of the resource allocation perspective, but from the ego perspective. You know, if you're, I think that an ambitious entrepreneur who has big plans for him or herself, you know, to buy, to operate a $3 million septic business, that can be fantastic and great, but they might have a larger appetite or a larger self image than that. But they still love this kind of world of small business and they love the idea of buying that business, that first step. But a hold co-path or a hold co-vision is a way to play in small business, but do something big, not do something small. And so it kind of scratches the ego itch, I think, for a lot of really ambitious entrepreneurs as well. I would also just maybe add the mathematical reality of if you do go fishing for bigger businesses and you're competing with independent sponsors and smaller private equity, maybe even the success ratio of stringing together a handful of 1.5 EBITDA businesses, could be a lot easier than finding one that is three, four or five million of EBITDA. There's a lot more buyers for those that are a lot more sophisticated and have better access to capital and resources. There's a lot of reasons that will push people to want to build a hold co-prop. We're going to better survey that next year. That was one of my learnings from this year's survey. You already know that business owners are making amazing use of virtual assistants. Often based in the Philippines. And while virtual assistants are helpful, virtual professionals are transformative. More Staffing is a boutique agency that hires A players in the Philippines, not for simple tasks, but for deep competency work. Think operators, supply chain managers, controllers. More Staffing de-risks your engagement with a 12-month guarantee to you, and they provide coaching for six months to their talent when an engagement begins. That means your hire is coached in the background, no additional cost to you, so that your working relationship flourishes and is as successful as it can be. Global Staffing is increasingly the norm, and building the muscle within your business to take advantage of it will be crucial in the years ahead. Speak with more Staffing about the pool of capable, affordable managers they can connect you with. Check out morenow.co. That's morenow.co. Just before we get into the survey itself, the survey results themselves, let's hear the counter arguments or what the detractors would say about this HoldCo phenomenon. For sure. It's focus. The canonical thing people point to is the thought you have in the shower, and you can only really do it for one business when you're not thinking what is it you think about, what is the epiphany that you have at the gym, or again, in the shower when you have five minutes. If you have two, three, four, ten businesses, statistically speaking, you're just less likely to find that on-lot. I do think if you have a business that you're thinking about, and so I do think if you have a platform business that has really scalable levers and really, really high quality attributes, a single business with 100% of an entrepreneur's focus can go farther than a HoldCo and can be a better decision based on your opportunity set, your risk appetite, and your skills. I fully agree that's a good thesis on the other side of the coin. I'll add to that too that one of the things that I see the detractors say is a lot of people are kind of putting the cart before the horse here with their HoldCo vision. Let's buy that first business, make sure the transition is okay, learn how to operate. Buying that first business is extremely challenging as this podcast talks about ad nauseum. Let's make sure you can do that and indeed like and want to do that before you talk about buying 10 of these guys. Yeah, we've gone through iterations of HoldCo vision up, down, and sideways. Anybody that's followed my journey at 365, it's been an interesting road. There have been some very recent people I look up to that have on HoldCo and kind of focused down on a single business. I would agree with your assessment. If you're listening to this as a searcher, leave the HoldCo thing second. Just find a company first and let's talk about business number two once business number one is chugging along. Great. All right, Kelsey. Give us a minute just on set the context of this survey methodology, who you pinged to participate. I looked back and realized that there's many organizations or communities that I follow or I'm a customer of that produce a report. So in e-commerce, I'm a member of e-commerce fuel. Each year Andrew Darien publishes the state of the merchant. And if you're in e-commerce, you're going to read this thing. I submit survey data. So do hundreds of other people. I read it like a very important document. Stanford search fund in your world is very popular. The guys at SIG did the self-funded survey. If you're up market and you're raising capital, you might read the McGuire Woods survey. There's industry surveys everywhere. And I realized that in this pocket of entrepreneurship called Holdcos, there was a lot of questions that were the same. People would come to our conference, HoldcoConf, seeking some of those things. I'd see it happen in Twitter conversations. I'd see it on search funder. And just the conference isn't enough to handle that. So we wanted to publish a report and begin to annually collect some data from self-identified Holdcos and try to get some consensus on some of these things as a better North Star or a way to point people towards an answer. Excellent. And yeah, I think that they are really powerful kind of stakes in the ground marketing tools for the organizations that put them out. So well done on jumping on it. All right. So tell us what did the aggregate response data set look like? How many people responded? So for sure. Real quick, I have a printed copy of the survey for anybody that's watching on video. But if you want to download the survey, go to Holdcosurvey.com. You can download it. It's free. That's where you can go reference all this. In the intro, we break down the aggregate of the survey respondents. We had just over 100 survey respondents. And most of it was a little bit of marketing from social media for the Holdco brand and some outreach that John and I did, asking people directly if they would participate. Great. So let's get into some of the key findings, Kelsey. Sure. Take us through. What was one of the findings that jumped out at you? For sure. The first thing is that most Holdcos are smaller than we think. So it's easy to go on the internet and see a giant name like Constellation Software or Permanent Equity or insert your favorite, successful Holdco that you're following. And then you get down to somebody like Kelsey or John Wilson or even an anonymous Twitter account and you see all this content. From survey respondents, most Holdcos are self-identified Holdco entrepreneurs, are much earlier in their journey and are much smaller than even I imagined. So a couple of insights. The survey was obviously done over the internet and it was anonymous. So we sourced respondents from Twitter, LinkedIn, LinkedIn, SearchFunder and outreach to our networks. And our survey sample size is a function of our outreach. So there are obviously many more Holdcos or entrepreneurs that didn't respond. We're only working off the data that we have. We have some survivorship bias there. But out of our 100 plus survey respondents, half weren't even eight figures in revenue and some of them only had one business. So to the average SearchFunder or declaring minds listener, you just assume every Holdco is obviously eight figures, obviously has two or more businesses. Yet we had people responding to a survey where many of them were much smaller in revenue and not dismissing them by business size. They're just anecdotally smaller. And some legitimately call themselves a Holdco with only one operating business. Now, certainly their business plan is to grow. But again, today they are functionally a single holding Holdco. Yeah. Well, I guess that ties back to our point about how much aspiration there is swirling around this concept. People kind of self-identifying as Holdco entrepreneurs, even though maybe technically they don't qualify. It's super easy to get the echo chamber of listening to the acquiring minds podcast and everybody's rolling up everything and all multiples go to the moon and there's no businesses left. Yet the reality is most of these Holdcos that we're all following, myself included, might be smaller than you think. Fascinating. And does that square with your kind of anecdotal experience of the folks who came, of the attendees at Holdco Conf last year? There was definitely a distribution of small to large. And our survey set internally for the conference last year anchored slightly larger. That also might be some outliers to the top, pulling that number up. I see here in our notes that you had an observation on headcount. For sure. Back to your comment earlier about John and I having a relationship and even starting a conference together and having very different businesses. In a guy in a truck business, which I would call John, plumbing, HVAC, all those traditional service businesses, revenue per field employee is a great metric. And many people overly simplify that down to just revenue per employee. And so you might look at Google's revenue per employee or Facebook's revenue per employee. And it gets incredibly deceiving. So we try to use many insights in the report as a measure against size. And so we reported against sometimes headcount, sometimes against revenue, sometimes against number of portfolio companies. But we're breaking down these insights. And we realized this is headcount is just very deceiving. Some businesses just have lower revenue per employee or higher. And that tends to get into a function of like, do you own restaurants? Or do you own software as a service? That metric gets to be incredibly deceiving unless you're very much apples to apples. It's just not a very insightful way to compare things. Soterios. And did you come to one metric to rule them all that you liked? We ended defaulting more often than not to global revenue as the best way to analyze that. Looking at our notes here, one of the other things that you observed was how, it's not just, do you have one business or do you have multiple? There is a spectrum like with anything of Holtcos and things change depending on the size of Holtco that you are. What did you find there? I think one of the questions, especially if you're maybe in the acquiring minds audience and you're one of those smaller operators buying your first business, you're trying to get date figures. One of the common questions is likely, when do things change? When do I graduate from SBA financing and I go get a big boy bank loan with no PG? When do I hire a high, highly compensated head of finance? When does my business really evolve in growing a Holtco? That's easier to answer industry specific. If you're in e-commerce, you can go join an e-commerce community. If you're in plumbing, you can go to an industry conference. There's a better trodden path of just growing a single service or product business of industry norms of when successful competitors have done things. It's less obvious when that happens in the Holtco space. And that's one of the things we wanted to key in on is what are the revenue benchmarks when you should start poking your head up to make meaningful changes in the business? So a couple of things happen according to survey data, really around 50 million is a good place to start thinking about meaningful changes. And then certainly these changes are ubiquitous at nine figures. I had thought some of these things happened earlier. We frankly, as an organization, are not at 50 million yet. We've tried to make some of these changes. I thought they happened at 20 or 25 or 30. But really, it's 50 million when a couple things happen. So one, the presence of outside equity. In all of our survey insights, you're much more likely to have outside equity over 50 million of revenue. The sophistication of your debt stack goes up dramatically. Many sellers staying on post-close and operational roles looking maybe more like a traditional private equity kind of world equity scenario. Leadership positions having like tangible, real equity grants, not just profit sharing or synthetic profit interests of some kind. And then hiring executives to lead M&A. That handful of things really is incredibly rare below $50 million in global revenue. Your point about the outside equity at 50 million, what do you think the direction of causation is there? Is it holding companies only get to 50 million? To get to 50 million, you probably need to have worked with investors and brought in outside equity. Or once you get to that level, you're kind of a sophisticated enough business that you're just going to... It's just from pure kind of capital allocation math, you're going to start seeking outside equity to accelerate your growth. I don't know that I have a precise answer to that because it is a bit chicken and the egg. And it's a bit a function of the strategy of the Holdco founder. So I don't know that I have a conclusive answer to that. I suspect it's a bit of both. Okay. On to the next finding. One of the other main topics that is a constant conversation is how to build a team, how to hire and incentivize and train leaders or operators in this entire notion of HR. So you're scaling Holdco. What services are at the parent company? What services are at the opco? Are we doing shared services? What level of seniority? There's just this kind of how do we staff this machine is an ongoing topic. What was a surprising insight is that even some very small Holdcos, again, those seven figure Holdcos report using profit sharing and phantom equity to incentivize compensation of leaders even early on in the journey, which I would not have anticipated being the case. Quite frequently, the first real executifiers tend to be either finance or operations. That's not surprising to me at least. Once those bases are covered, marketing and HR are the ones that quickly follow. The takeaway to me, if you're listening to this and you either have a business and you're trying to go Holdco or you may have a very small Holdco is as you're thinking about the things you can delegate as an entrepreneur and the way you can staff up, the data seems to say is the first move is finance or ops and the second move is marketing and HR. Meaning as a founder, you need to retain marketing and HR longer and you need to be more comfortable running those functions yourself until you can afford to hire somebody to help with those. That's an interesting thought or observation because a lot of people in this world come from financial backgrounds. Interesting that the data suggests that that's also one of the first things offloaded to an employee. Theoretically, it's the place where HQ, as it were, can add value to the operating companies. If you presume that you have a decentralized model and you have operators making decisions on things like hiring, things like marketing spend, and maybe those decisions are perhaps pushed down, the place you could add value at the senior level or at HQ is through high level CFO, COO type of work. At 365, what was the sequencing of these leadership positions? That's a good question. I think for us, it would go marketing first because e-commerce tends to be a marketing forward business. Finance was retained a little longer. HR was the last thing we brought in. For us, ops and supply chain has been a winding road, but again, e-commerce native, I think you move marketing to the front end in my world. I think that's probably different for some others. Great. Now, one of the things you've already touched on it, one of the things that comes up again and again in thinking about holdcos is a centralized model or a decentralized model. Centralized being where the mothership or corporate or whatever, where the holdco operator or where the holdco operator founder sits is providing shared services to all of the holdcos, to all of the holdco portcos, the portfolio companies. Logic being that you should be able to get some scale from that. If you have one HR person to manage hiring at your four different portfolio companies, it's a great use of resources because you just have to do that one hire for four businesses. Then you'll hear detractors to that logic as well and that it just isn't ever quite as clean as the logic would suggest. What did you see here? In the data, nobody reporting large revenues, so we're going to go back to that $50 million bogey. Virtually nobody there is using any semblance of vertical integration. The trend of building a decentralized holdco where operations are pushed down is very much in the data. Many leadership teams are very small, just two or three people. I think the canonical reference being however many people are in Omaha, you can feed them on a couple of pizzas at Berkshire, seems to be true of scaled holdcos in the small business space, just a handful. Just using your own holdco again, Kelsey, maybe e-commerce is different again because there's less moving parts in some sense. If you're doing your own picking and shipping, picking, packing and shipping, that adds a whole other element certainly. What have you found in terms of your attempts at centralization? We've had fits and starts on our decision-making there. Historically, we've been very centralized and very verticalized because there's a thesis around that. I think that our opinion on that has evolved and we're looking to fragment the brands into some more divisional structures as we go. We are moving more decentralized at 365. More decentralized. Yes. You're moving more decentralized. Okay. Let's turn to the next finding. For sure. Again, with a diversified portfolio of businesses, there are certainly some roll-ups in our sample. I only buy landscaping or I only buy SaaS or whatever my thesis might be. Many holdcos are industry diverse and we have some stats on that in the survey, but I wanted to get a sense of expectations or trends for 2023, kind of an economic outlook. We're recording this in August. The year is half over. We started the survey back in January, but I think it's indicative of small business entrepreneurship writ large. There is several hundred portfolio companies represented in the 100 plus survey respondents. Again, our survey respondents are these aspirational small business entrepreneurs. I thought it'd be an interesting place to get a diverse pulse on small business. One trend we wanted to talk about was global hiring. I think you can't listen to a podcast or scroll a Twitter feed or anything without hearing about hiring a VA in the Philippines. We asked about that. What was interesting is we had overwhelmingly strong response. Many people were doing it and nobody was dissatisfied. However, 76% of survey respondents who were globally outsourcing stated they were still figuring it out, meaning it wasn't perfect. It wasn't terrible. They weren't throwing it out. It was a common trend. It was a growing topic in their business, but it was not figured out. Most of the talent is being sourced from the Philippines and more than half of survey respondents had global talent. We assumed our audience was US-based entrepreneurs. That hype apparently is real. The success is in progress for most small business hold-cos. Have you guys used talent in the Philippines or elsewhere? For sure. We have scaled that up ourselves. It's been a really good success. We've had a lot of talent. For sure. We have scaled that up ourselves in the last two years. I would say I'd like to think we're better than still figuring it out, but like many things in our business, we're still figuring it out. I'm a proponent of it. I think it's a good thing. When you guys were solidly in the still figuring it out bucket, what was the hardest thing or two to figure out? Cultural adaptation for our US team of how to effectively leverage global resources and to document, systematize, and build process for a part of the team that's not physically present and has a different operating cadence and culture than the in-office physical co-located team. Could I distill that to the one word of communication, which is often the sticking point in an intercontinental operation? I've got one more insight on the expectation. I wanted to just get a really rough economic forecast, if you will. The survey shook out from respondents. 11% expected a down or flat year on revenue. However, 56% are worried about a recession and soft demand. Said differently, a very small segment of the survey thought they'd have a bad year. Everybody else said they're growing, yet more than half said recession or soft demand, which seems to be counterintuitive. I'm not sure if hold co-CEOs or optimists are risk takers, or if they answered that saying, you know what, I'm going to buy some more revenue this year and my whole portfolio will inevitably grow and I can outpace a recession or I can outpace soft demand. With all the talk about interest rates and cost of capital, that was the lowest rated concern on the radar for hold co-CEOs. Again, maybe we're all just risk taking daredevils, or maybe the 1% gyration really is not that critical in the grand scheme of things. It's hard to tell, but soft outlook economically paired with a non-concern for interest rates and expected revenue growth is kind of the summary for the economic forecast. Do you think the lack of interest rate concern is because if you're a hold co-recognizing that a lot of these respondents are hold co-aspirants, not actual hold co-aspirants, versus a lot of my guests who have one business in SBA loan and the debt ratio is a much tighter, it's a much tighter tolerance there. If you're a hold co-recognizing and you've got $10 million, $20 million, $50 million of revenue, you just got more cash to play with so it's not going to asphyxiate you if the interest rates move. In theory, if you're a hold co-recognizing that's five years in and you've got one company every year, you are slowly de-levering, diversifying and de-risking. Yes, interest rates are a real cost to doing business, but as time goes on and your balance sheet gets better, they have potentially less of an impact on the business. Potentially less of an impact on your operation. Excellent, Kelsey. Were there any more or was that it? I wanted to ask you a couple of closing questions. We can move on to the closing questions. There is a lot to go read in the report. If anybody wants to get all the nitty-gritty details, go download it, but those are the things I wanted to share today. Give us the URL again. Yes, it's holdcosurvey.com. H-O-L-D-C-O-SURVEY.COM. Great. Kelsey, so last year's Hold Co-Conf was the inaugural conference. The second annual is coming up when? September 18th, 19th and 20th in Cleveland, Ohio. Great. In about six weeks in Cleveland. What were some of your takeaways from that first event last year? Just give us a picture for those of us who were not there. Yeah, I think Jon and I set out to have fun and not lose money, and we were successful at both of those endeavors, so proud about that and happy to do it again. We really wanted to build an event that was a lot of fun and very valuable, but really built relationships and didn't just have people sitting in a hotel ballroom for hours on end. So we use a non-traditional venue. We invest a lot in food and drink and experiences and activities. The lessons we really learned from last year is that we could build a little more structure around that. Last year we had a bunch of keynotes and some small group discussions. This year we're changing up that format to really build some better interaction and problem solving amongst holdcos. That happened informally last year, but one of the few pieces of critical feedback we got, and I tried to get as much as I could. Thankfully everybody enjoyed their time last year. A few pieces of critical feedback was a better structure problem solving. So this year we're going to try to orchestrate some intentional connections and intentional topics. They bubbled up organically, but in two and a half days with a hundred plus people to meet, I think some intentionality around helping people solve the top issues on their mind will increase the value add and the productivity of the time people spend together this year. And so we're excited about that. You know, Kelsey, one of the things that we haven't talked about, and I'm not sure it was in the survey or not, but I wonder what the temperature among holdco operators, entrepreneurs is for deal flow itself, for access to more opportunities. Is that something you have any sense of? That's a great question. We had deal flow questions in the survey, and I don't remember if we talked about that in particular. That might be a good one to add for next year. Our sponsor for the survey this year was Axial. It was our headlining sponsor for the conference last year. They're obviously a deal sourcing platform. There's a recording date we have on our YouTube channel from their talk last year that talked about some really macro data that is kind of interesting if anybody hasn't seen that and you want to know the deal flow dynamics, that was interesting. Obviously that's from the vendor perspective, not from the operator perspective. And speaking of Axial and kind of something you said at the top when talking about the gap that holdco comp fills, how many private equity types are there? I would say it's less than 20% would be a traditional fund model based private equity. I think all of us call ourselves investors. All of us call ourselves, quote unquote, micro private equity. I have a holdco. In the holdco survey, which again, survey respondents might be indicative of the conference, but not 100% the same. In the survey, many of the survey respondents were self-funded, did not have outside capital. So I think at holdco comp, this year I'm hoping that 20% of our attendees have committed capital, whether it's a fund or syndication that are attending. Tell us the dates again, Kelsey, the URL, and then I think you got a code for the audience. I do. So holdco comp, H-O-L-D-C-O-C-O-N-F.com is the website September 18th through 20th in Cleveland. And for listeners of acquiring minds, you can use M-I-N-D-S, minds off a ticket for a special discount on your ticket purchase. And can you tell us what that discount is going to be? We will do 600 off a single ticket and we need to make a second code off two tickets. So just email in if you need help with that. It's events at holdcoconf.com. But single tickets are all inclusive with hotel and everything. And it's $600 off of the website price with M-I-N-D-S. Excellent. Thank you for offering that to us, Kelsey. And if people want to get in touch with you personally, what's the best way? I am easily found on Twitter. My email is easily guessed and on LinkedIn as well. And if it's anything about the conference, you can just email in to events at holdcoconf.com. People have been pinging me about the conference and I've been very politely shuffling them over to the events team. Thankfully, we have some good help there this year and I'm excited about that. Kelsey Lerick, thank you very much for coming on. A really interesting look into inside this this Holdco phenomenon. Great. Again, congratulations on a great idea to kind of be the survey around this space. I love it. Appreciate that so much. Thank you for having me and I appreciate being here."}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast episode, Kelsey Lerick, the co-founder and CEO of 365 Holdings, discusses the Holdco phenomenon and shares insights from a survey conducted with Holdco operators. The survey revealed that most Holdcos are smaller than expected, with many being in the seven-figure revenue range and having only one operating business. Additionally, the survey found that Holdco entrepreneurs often use profit sharing and phantom equity to incentivize compensation for leaders. The data also showed a trend towards decentralized Holdcos, with operations being pushed down to individual businesses. Another interesting finding was that many Holdcos are still figuring out global hiring, with a majority of respondents using talent from the Philippines. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Holdco CEOs were not particularly concerned about interest rates. Lastly, Lerick shared some insights from the first Holdco Conf conference and announced details for this year's event.", "podcast_guest": {"name": "Kelsey Lerick", "org": "365 Holdings", "title": "", "summary": "Not Available"}, "podcast_highlights": "- Most Holdcos are smaller than we think, with many of them being self-identified Holdco entrepreneurs who are earlier in their journey and smaller than anticipated.\n- It is common for Holdcos to use profit sharing and phantom equity to incentivize compensation, even in the early stages of their business.\n- Leadership positions in Holdcos tend to start with finance or operations, followed by marketing and HR.\n- Many Holdcos are industry diverse and are still figuring out global hiring, with a majority sourcing talent from the Philippines.\n- Holdco entrepreneurs have a positive revenue outlook but express concerns about a recession and soft demand. Interest rates are not a major concern for them."}
